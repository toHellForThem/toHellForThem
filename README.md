## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Main

My name is Vadim. I'm a novice developer, I'm currently taking an AI development course. I graduated from college with a degree in software engineering. In college, I got to know the main points of web application development.

This is a list of what I understand:
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL
- Python(learning)

# My experience

My first project was a static website from scratch. It was an online store based on simple knowledge of HTML and CSS, then I managed to make a pretty beautiful page. That was 5 years ago.
Then I started solving problems in PHP, it was like the first real programming.
The second project was a graduation project. I made a website on a Wordpress cms, but due to ignorance of JS, I was only able to run it on a local server.
